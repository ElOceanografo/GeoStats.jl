Kriging estimation is about minimizing variance (or estimation error), whereas Spline interpolation is about forcedly smooth estimators derived for computer visualization. Kriging is a generalization of Splines in which one has the freedom to customize spatial structure based on data. Besides the estimate itself, Kriging also provides the variance map as a function of knots configuration.","category":"page"},{"location":"resources/education/#MLJ.jl-1","page":"Education","title":"MLJ.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"resources/education/#","page":"Education","title":"Education","text":"MLJ.jl - Statistical learning (a.k.a. machine learning) theory relies on a set of assumptions that do not hold with spatial data (e.g i.i.d. samples on fixed-size support, stationarity, to name a few).
